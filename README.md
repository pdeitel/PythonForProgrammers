**NOTE:** If you're trying to run the RollDieDynamic.py script in Chapter 1 and the window does not appear, this is due to a known issue in the software for which a fix is already in process. You can instead run the program with 

>`ipython -i RollDieDynamic.py 6000 1`
    
Then terminate IPython interactive mode (Ctrl + D twice) after you close the script's window.
